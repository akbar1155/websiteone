        Programming requires a programmer to have an analytical mind. Otherwise,
        it will be difficult to find a solution to any problem. In programming,
        all code is logically sequenced, and this logic cannot be lost.
        Otherwise, something doesn't look the same and you have to go from code
        to code looking for a bug or worse. You have to keep thinking
        analytically and remember that everywhere, especially in programming,
        there is a logic to follow. As in any other work, in programming, focus
        and the ability to focus on a task or an element is considered a very
        important skill. Hundreds, and even thousands, of lines of code is a
        process that a programmer often faces.{" "}
